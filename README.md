#Flights Scrapper
The aim of this project is to develop a Airline domain specific deep Web tool that presents a
single interface to users. Upon submission of a query via this interface, the tool
submits queries to multiple hidden databases via front-end query interfaces of different Airline Websites like Spicejet,JetAirways etc. The tool should then be able to extract and interpret the Flight results like timings,tickets available,price etc received from different Airline Websites.

This tool will hopefully simplify the way a user searches for information that might be
scattered in several hidden web databases. A single interface is presented to the
user instead of the user querying several interfaces one by one.
So it is basically Scraping of hidden data using python.
